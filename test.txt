This is just a sample account file to test the formating of user info! 
(it's outside of the users folder so it doesn't get all messed up hehe)

Things an account needs:
    - JOBS
    - SUM
    - PROJECTIONS
    - PAYMENTS PER MONTH (PPM)

The sequence "## " indicates where info starts.
The sequence "--" indicates where reading should stop.
Every entry is separated by line.
Every key is matched with a value.
    Keys and values separated by sequence " ; ".

This section registers the various jobs.
Format: "JOB NAME (string) ; JOB PAY (double)"
## JOBS
Research Institute ; 16.24
CS Assistant ; 15.74

This section registers user's sum at various times.
Format: "DATE (string) ; SUM (double)"
Note: date is recorded as YYYY/MM/DD (0s included)
## SUM
2023/09/30 ; 53.03

This section is similar to SUM, but registers only future projections.
Format: "CURR DATE (string) ; PROJECTED DATE (string) ; PROJECTED SUM (double)
## PROJECTIONS
2023/09/30 ; 2023/10/01 ; 53.03

This section's weird cause it just stores one atom of info,
The frequency at which the user gets paid in the month
Format: "PPM (int) ; PAYDAY (string (monday-sunday))"
## PAYMENTS PER MONTH
2 ; thursday
